There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal
value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his
two neighbors left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?

Examples:

Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19

Solution:

We create a DP array,

dp[0] = arr[0]
dp[1] = max(arr[0], arr[1])

Iterate dp -> 2 to n-1
    Everytime dp[i] = max(dp[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1])
