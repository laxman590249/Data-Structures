A priority queue and a heap are related concepts in computer science, but they are not the same thing.
A heap is a data structure that can be used to implement a priority queue, which is an abstract concept.

Here's the difference between a priority queue and a heap:

**Priority Queue:**
A priority queue is an abstract data type that stores a collection of elements, each with an associated priority.
Elements in a priority queue can be inserted and removed, and the element with the highest (or lowest) priority is always at the front and can be efficiently accessed.
Priority queues do not dictate the specific implementation; they describe the behavior and operations that should be supported.

**Heap:**
A heap is a specific implementation of a priority queue.
It is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: for a min-heap, each parent node has a value less than or equal to its child nodes,
and for a max-heap, each parent node has a value greater than or equal to its child nodes.
Heaps are particularly efficient for insertion and removal of the highest (or lowest) priority element because they maintain the heap property as elements are added or removed.

In summary:

- A priority queue is an abstract concept that defines the behavior of elements with priorities and the operations that can be performed on them.
- A heap is a concrete data structure that implements a priority queue. It is based on a binary tree structure with the heap property.

It's important to note that there are different types of heaps, such as binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, and more, each with its own characteristics and
performance trade-offs. While heaps are a common implementation of priority queues, other data structures could also be used to implement priority queues,
like self-balancing binary search trees.
