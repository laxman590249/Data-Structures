"""
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color
are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]


Input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Solution:

Take three pointers
red, white and blue
